## Connect your device

Make sure your physical device is connected to your computer before starting.

## Start the dev environment

After [installing](/docs/installation) expo-air, start everything with one command:

```bash
npx expo-air@latest fly
```

This launches three services and sets up Cloudflare tunnels for remote development:

1. **Prompt server** (port 3847) — WebSocket server connecting the widget to Claude
2. **Widget Metro** (port 8082) — Serves the floating widget UI
3. **App Metro** (port 8081) — Standard Expo Metro for your app code

<Callout type="info">
  If you prefer local development without tunnels (e.g., device and Mac on the
  same network), you can use `npx expo-air@latest start` instead. See [Remote
  Development](/docs/remote-development) for more details.
